/*
 * This routine is designed to tune the open-loop feedforward coefficients. Although it may seem unnecessary,
 * tuning these coefficients is just as important as the positional parameters. Like the other
 * manual tuning routines, this op mode relies heavily upon the dashboard. To access the dashboard,
 * connect your computer to the RC's WiFi network. In your browser, navigate to
 * https://192.168.49.1:8080/dash if you're using the RC phone or https://192.168.43.1:8080/dash if
 * you are using the Control Hub. Once you've successfully connected, start the program, and your
 * robot will begin moving forward and backward according to a motion profile. Your job is to graph
 * the velocity errors over time and adjust the feedforward coefficients. Once you've found a
 * satisfactory set of gains, add them to the appropriate fields in the DriveConstants.java file.
 *
 * Pressing Y/Δ (Xbox/PS4) will pause the tuning process and enter driver override, allowing the
 * user to reset the position of the bot in the event that it drifts off the path.
 * Pressing B/O (Xbox/PS4) will cede control back to the tuning process.
