 * This is a simple teleop routine for testing localization. Drive the robot around like a normal
 * teleop routine and make sure the robot's estimated pose matches the robot's actual pose (slight
 * errors are not out of the ordinary, especially with sudden drive motions). The goal of this
 * exercise is to ascertain whether the localizer has been configured properly (note: the pure
 * encoder localizer heading may be significantly off if the track width has not been tuned).
