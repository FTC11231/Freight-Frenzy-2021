/*
 * This routine determines the effective track width. The procedure works by executing a point turn
 * with a given angle and measuring the difference between that angle and the actual angle (as
 * indicated by an external IMU/gyro, track wheels, or some other localizer). The quotient
 * given angle / actual angle gives a multiplicative adjustment to the estimated track width
 * (effective track width = estimated track width * given angle / actual angle). The routine repeats
 * this procedure a few times and averages the values for additional accuracy. Note: a relatively
 * accurate track width estimate is important or else the angular constraints will be thrown off.
